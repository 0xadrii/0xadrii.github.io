I’ve always had a natural curiosity for computers. As a child, I loved taking things apart and putting them back together. At the age of 16 I started programming and discovered one of my passions. My love for developing continued to increase and I soon obtained a Computer Science degree from La Salle University in Barcelona.

After obtaining my Computer Science degree, I started my role as Blockchain Developer in Themar Solutions.
In march 2022 I joined Unlockd, a protocol that allows users to borrow using their NFTs as collateral.

When I’m not working on the Unlockd protocol, I’m either checking Smart Contract vulnerabilities
and going deep into Code4rena/Sherlock audit contests or spending time at the gym.

If you need help with a code audit or you're looking for a project advisor, don’t hesitate to contact me.
